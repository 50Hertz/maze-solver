# Maze Solver
**Question:** (TRAVERSING A MAZE) Consider a n x n maze with one entry point and one exit and all free and blocked cells clearly identifieded. Which search algorithm do you think is suitable for traversing the maze? Provide a web-based implementation of the algorithm and test it. You may use Java or C++ to implement the algorithm. Ensure that your implementation includes a graphical display of the maze. All relevant data structures used must be clearly defined.

## Prerequisites

* Java 8
* Spring Boot 2.3.10
* Apache Maven 3.6

## Usage

* Package the maze-traversal-api using Maven: 
  ```maven
  mvn clean package
